- **Snake Animation Line**: The line `<img src="https://github.com/Mohideen2005/Mohideen2005/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg" alt="Snake Animation"/>` is already included in the “GitHub Stats” section, ensuring it’s part of the profile.

#### Step 2: Ensure the Snake Animation Workflow is Set Up
The snake animation requires a GitHub Action to generate the SVG file. Let’s confirm the workflow is in place and has run successfully.

1. **Verify the Workflow File**:
   - In `Mohideen2005/Mohideen2005`, go to the **Code** tab.
   - Look for `.github/workflows/snake.yml`.
   - If it exists, ensure it matches:
     ```yaml
     name: Generate Snake Animation
     on:
       schedule:
         - cron: "0 0 * * *" # Runs daily at midnight UTC (5:30 AM IST)
       workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering
       push:
         branches:
           - main
     jobs:
       generate-snake:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout repository
             uses: actions/checkout@v4
           - name: Generate snake animation
             uses: Platane/snk@v3
             with:
               github_user_name: Mohideen2005
               outputs: |
                 output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg
           - name: Commit and push changes
             uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v5
             with:
               commit_message: "Update snake animation SVG"
               file_pattern: output/*.svg
